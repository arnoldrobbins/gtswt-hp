============================

This is the original port of the Georgia Tech Software Tools Subsystem
`hp' program to C.  The files are dated November 26, 1985.  This version
used the Unix port of the STACC (STill Another Compiler Compiler) parser
generator (see https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/stacc) for its rather
simple grammar.

The st.parse.c and st.parse.h files were recreated in April 2015 using
stacc.

I'm making this available in case there are any other GT SWT users
out there who are interested.  I will make a separate github repo
for my current version of this program (that I still use!) which
uses yacc and a simple hand-written scanner.
